# Sample Runbook

This repository contains an example of an operations runbook that can be used by
IT or Release Engineering.  It was created as a companion to a blog post on Medium
called [Building a Better Ops Runbook](https://medium.com/@shawnstafford/ops-runbook-16017fa78733).

This runbook uses the JFrog Artifactory application as a fictitious example to
show how a runbook can be used to describe the operationally important information
about an application.  Although this runbook might normally be created in a wiki
or content management system, it was convenient to create it on GitHub in Markdown
format so that users could easily view or print a full example in addition to
the information provided in the blog post.
